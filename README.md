A classic game of RPS made in association with The Odin Project. It can be played at [GitHub Pages](https://emilravn.github.io/rockpaperscissors/).

## Rules of Rock Paper Scissors

Each turn consists of the player making a distinct choice and the computer making a random choice of either "rock", "paper" or "scissors". The first to reach 5 points win the game. A draw does not equal to a point.

- Rock beats Scissors.
- Paper beats Rock.
- Scissors beats Paper.

Have fun!
